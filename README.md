# Simple calculator by using Python language

## Python Calculator

Overview
- The Python Calculator is a straightforward and user-friendly application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator can be built using various approaches in Python, ranging from a simple command-line interface (CLI) to a more advanced graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.

Basic Operations:
- Addition: Adds two numbers.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
- Division: Divides one number by another, handling division by zero errors gracefully.

## Project Learning

- Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Implementing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division helps reinforce understanding of fundamental mathematical operations in programming.

- User Input Handling:
Learning to prompt for and correctly handle user input, ensuring the inputs are appropriate for the calculations being performed.

- Function Creation:
Writing functions for each arithmetic operation teaches you how to structure code into reusable blocks, making it more organized and modular.

- Error Handling:
Implementing error handling, such as managing division by zero and invalid inputs, enhances your ability to write robust and error-resistant programs.

- Control Flow:
Using control flow statements (like if-else) to select operations based on user input helps understand how to direct the program's flow based on conditions.

## These points encapsulate the core learning experiences from building a basic Python Calculator using a command-line interface.
